1st Year Physics Bsc Undergraduate at University of Warwick.

I code minecraft plugins and mods for Build the Earth UK, and Build the Earth itself.

I also have other fun projects from time to time, for example learning how to read pixels of a png image and metadata in java and using this to determine what time was displayed on a phone screenshot taken.

I am also working on a longer term project to programme a human mind, with feelings and a dynamic personality. He/she will have a well organised knowledge bank and be able to understand and explain the concepts he/she knows.
It will also have communication skills which is a fundamental asset of the human race.

**Note**: All BTE UK projects are being moved to the BTE UK organisation.
